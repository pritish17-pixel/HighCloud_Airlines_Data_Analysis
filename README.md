# 🛫 High Cloud Airlines Data Analysis Project  

## 📊 Project Overview  
This project analyzes **airline performance data (2008–2013)** to gain insights into passenger distribution, load factors, carrier performance, and distance-based flight trends.  
The analysis was performed using **Power BI**, **Excel**, **Tableau**, and **MySQL**, with visual dashboards created to highlight key metrics and performance patterns.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- To analyze **Load Factor %** trends across years, routes, and carriers.  
- To determine **Top Performing Airlines** and **Routes**.  
- To evaluate **flight frequency by distance groups**.  
- To study performance differences between **Weekdays and Weekends**.  
- To visualize key airline statistics using interactive dashboards.
